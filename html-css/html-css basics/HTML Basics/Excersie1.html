    <h1>My Personal Introduction</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name <strong>Michael Shermak</strong> I am a curious and motivated learner who is beginning a journey
        into the world of web development. I enjoy
        understanding how websites work and how code can turn ideas into real, usable products.
        I am especially interested in learning how the web is built from the ground up, starting with structure and
        moving toward more advanced logic and interaction. Learning step by step helps me build confidence and clarity.
        I believe that consistency and practice are the keys to improvement, and I am committed to developing strong
        foundations in programming.</p>

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
        I enjoy working with technology because it combines creativity and logical thinking. <strong>Coding</strong>
        allows me to solve
        problems in a structured way while still expressing ideas.
        When I am not studying programming, I like learning new things, exploring how systems work, and challenging
        myself with new topics. I am particularly interested in how technology can improve everyday life.</p>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>My main goal is to <strong> be comfortable with the basics of web development</strong> and gradually advance to
        more
        complex
        projects. I want to understand not just how to write code, but why it works.
    </p>
    <h3>Short-term Goals</h3>
    <p>
        In the short term, my focus is on mastering <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, practicing regularly,
        and
        building simple
        projects that demonstrate what I have learned.</p>
